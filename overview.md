<p align="center" style="font-weight:bold">Atomic Redis Queue</p>

A distributed, reliable, atomic, work queueing system that only requires redis as the backend.

Is **Worqr** for me?

- You need to distribute a task workload
- You are already using Redis in your application
- You don't want to run a queue service or pay per-transaction fees

If the answer to all three of those questions is yes, then **Worqr** is for you.
